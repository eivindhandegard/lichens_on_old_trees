# Introduction

In this section we examine the impact of the age of old trees on the alpha diversity of epiphytic lichens while controlling for confounding variables such as tree size and environmental variables. To answer this question, we used two complementary approaches. The first approach look at species richness and age from the entire sample of the first two meters of the sample trees. Consequently, approach A enabled us to untangle the role of tree age versus size, and how productivity may play into this. However, to further control for size we also inventoried a fixed area each sample tree to make them comparable across different tree sizes. To find the species density All trees had in addition two subplots, one in the south and one in the north.

To further understand the causal effect of age on the alpha diversity of epiphytic lichens we will use a framework of hypotheses with multiple steps looking like this:

### Hypothesis framework

| If H~0~ falsified because species richness increases with age then we go to the next step                                                                                 |

# Analysis

## Exploratory analyses

### Kendall's tau correlation between environmental variables + species richness

**Comments to the correlation plots:**

X signifies that the correlation has a p value \> 0.05

NB: Beware of Simpson's paradox when interpreting these rank based correlation plots.

#### Pine

```{r}
pine_var <- pine_species_richness_age |>
  mutate(branch_thickness = as.ordered(branch_thickness)) |> 
  mutate(branch_thickness = as.numeric(branch_thickness)) |> 
  filter(!is.na(age))

#pine_var <- apply(pine_var,2,as.numeric) 


# correlation matrix
 pine_cor <- cor(pine_var, method = "kendall")

 #Significance values 
 pval <- cor.mtest(pine_cor) 
 corrplot( pine_cor, p.mat =  pval$p, diag = T, type = "upper", sig.level = 0.05)
```

#### Spruce

```{r}
spruce_var <- spruce_species_richness_age |> 
  filter(!is.na(age))

spruce_var <- apply(spruce_var,2,as.numeric) 


# correlation matrix
 spruce_cor <-cor( spruce_var, method = "kendall")

 #Significance values 
 pval <- cor.mtest(spruce_cor) 
 corrplot( spruce_cor, p.mat =  pval$p, diag = T, type = "upper", sig.level = 0.05)
  
```

Site index and elevation are strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, it might be wise to choose one of them later on in the alpha diversity analysis.

Branch thickness is also clearly correlated with the different productivity variables. This makes sense as low productive forests are more open which equals more light.

The lichen epiphyte richness is correlated with all the productivity variables

### exploratory age plot

The scale of the plots are the same for both tree species.

#### Pine exploratory age plot

```{r}
  
pine_species_richness_age.plot <- exploratory_plot(pine_species_richness_age) 

# ggsave("pine_species_richness_age.plot.jpeg",pine_species_richness_age.plot, dpi = 250)
# 15.9 x 11.3 brukt tidligere


print(pine_species_richness_age.plot)
```

#### Spruce exploratory age plot

```{r}

spruce_species_richness_age.plot <- exploratory_plot(spruce_species_richness_age)

print(spruce_species_richness_age.plot)
```

### Both tree species in the same plot

```{r}

          , legend.text = element_text(size = 12)
          , legend.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
          , legend.position = c(0.15,0.85)) +
    xlim(0,425) +
    ylim(0,30) 
print(scatterplot_output)
```

## Models species richness on the entire sample trees

#### First level

Testing the following hypothesis:

Null hypothesis, H0s: No effect of tree age on lichen alpha diversity.

H1: There is a positive relationship between tree age and lichen richness

```{r}

pinemod<- glmer(species~ 
                  scale(age, center = T, scale = T) 
                + (1|locality/plot), family = ("poisson"),
                data = pine_species_richness_age)


sprucemod <- glmer(species~ scale(age, center = T, scale = T)
                    + (1|locality/plot) , family = ("poisson") , data = spruce_species_richness_age)


sjPlot:: tab_model(sprucemod,pinemod,  dv.labels = c("Spruce species richness", "Pine species richness"))

```

The lichen epiphyte richness is positively related to tree age for both species, and thus the first null hypothesis is rejected. This association has the strongest evidence for spruce.There appears to be a quite small effect size for both species.

We go on to the next level in the hypothesis testing

#### **Second level: Why could tree age related to increased alpha diversity?**

Alternative hypothesis H~a2~: Alpha diversity increases with age because tree size increases with age, which in turn increases the surface for establishment of lichens).

PredictionÂ 2: Species richness increases more with the size than with the age of trees.

```{r}
#####

pinemod<- glmer(species~ 
                  scale(age, center = T, scale = T) 
                  + scale(dbh, center = T, scale = T)
                  + branch_thickness
                 + + (1|locality/plot) , family = ("poisson") , data = pine_species_richness_age)

sprucemod <- glmer(species~ scale(age, center = T, scale = T) 
                      + scale(dbh, center = T, scale = T)
                      + scale(branch_thickness.numeric, center = T, scale = T)
                    + + (1|locality/plot) , family = ("poisson") , data = spruce_species_richness_age)

sjPlot:: tab_model(sprucemod,pinemod,  dv.labels = c("Spruce species richness", "Pine species richness"))
```

The null hypothesis cannot rejected for spruce, but none of the variables are significant for pine. The species richness seems to more or less equal due tree age and size to tree age. It is also clear from the analysis that alpha diversity is related to large branched trees for spruce trees and not necessarily just large diameter trees. This is likely due to all the pendulous lichens that grow on the branches.

This will be further tested later from the sub-plots on the stem.

#### Testing productivity

                  scale(age, center = T, scale = T) 
                  + scale(site_index, center = T, scale = T)
                  + scale(elevation, center = T, scale = T)
                  + scale(basal_area, center = T, scale = T)
                + (1 |locality/plot), family = ("poisson"),
                data = pine_species_richness_age)


sprucemod <- glmer(species~ scale(age, center = T, scale = T) 
                     + scale(site_index, center = T, scale = T)
                      + scale(elevation, center = T, scale = T)
                      + scale(basal_area, center = T, scale = T)
                    + (1|locality/plot) , family = ("poisson") , data = spruce_species_richness_age)


sjPlot:: tab_model(sprucemod,pinemod,  dv.labels = c("Spruce species richness", "Pine species richness"))
```

### Comments to the models

All of the models converge without any problems. The only error messages are from the spruce models has singular random effects structure, but otherwise no error messages.

### Testing H~a3:~Species density on the tree stem increases with age because of a longer time span for colonization. 

If H0 falsified because alpha diversity increases with age then we move on to the species density where the area surveyed is the same.

H~a3~ : Species density on the tree stem increases with age because of a longer time span for colonization.

Prediction 3: Species density increases with tree age.

full_mod_size_independent <- glmer(species~ scale(age, center = T, scale = T) + tree_species        + (1|locality/plot) 
                      , family = poisson,

The null hypothesis is rejected for pine, but not spruce. The species density increases with tree age for pine and we accept H~a3~ .

### Testing H~a4~: Species density on the tree stem increases with age because growth stagnation in older trees 

H~a4~: Species density on the tree stem increases with age because growth stagnation in older trees facilitate establishment of lichens.

Prediction 4: Species density is more correlated with the average growth rate of the trees than their age.

```{r}

#pinemodel
pine_species_richness_age |>
  filter(!is.na(locality )) -> pine_species_richness_age


pinemod_size_independent_growth_rate  <- glmer(species~  
                      scale(growthrate, center = T, scale = T)
                    + (1|locality/plot), family = poisson , data = pine_species_richness_age)


#spruce model

sprucemod_size_independent_growth_rate <- glmer(species~ scale(growthrate, center = T, scale = T)
                      + (1|locality/plot),family = poisson, data = spruce_species_richness_age)

sjPlot:: tab_model(sprucemod_size_independent_growth_rate ,pinemod_size_independent_growth_rate ,dv.labels = c("Spruce species density", "Pine species density") )


full_mod_size_independent <- glmer(species~ scale(growthrate, center = T, scale = T) + tree_species        + (1|locality/plot) 
                      , family = poisson,
                data = species_richness_age)

sjPlot:: tab_model(full_mod_size_independent, dv.labels = c("Both tree species  density") )
```

This might be because they have more open crowns that are not shading the stem. It may be that a longer time span for colonization is more important than bark stability for pine. This makes sense as pine trees develop large bark plates that very slippery and can shed.
